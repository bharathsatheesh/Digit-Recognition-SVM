This solution is an implementation of digit recognition using our own variant of the MNIST dataset by SVM. Your job is to build a 
classifier that, given the raw text of an email, can classify it as spam or ham(not-spam). You have the freedom and are encouraged 
to generate new features (and maybe discard or modify some of ours) to improve your accuracy. Your baseline accuracy 
(with the features provided) should give you around 75% accuracy, although with smart feature engineering, we can achieve better performance.

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

1) Typing in Question12 runs both problem 1 and problem 2. It plots the error data and returns the 7 confusion matrices in order k = 100,200,500,1000,2000,5000,10000.
The coloring of the confusion matrices also happen which is recorded in the other file

3) Typing in Question3 runs question 3. I used a time step of 0.1, because it was advertised as better!

4) Typing in Question4 should run this question, It uses almost the same principles as question 3.My initial subset here as well as in Q3 is 772 for convinience.
