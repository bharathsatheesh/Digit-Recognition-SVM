How to run?
1) Typing in Question12 runs both problem 1 and problem 2. It plots the error data and returns the 7 confusion matrices in order k = 100,200,500,1000,2000,5000,10000.
The coloring of the confusion matrices also happen which is recorded in the other file

3) Typing in Question3 runs question 3. I used a time step of 0.1, because it was advertised as better!

4) Typing in Question4 should run this question, It uses almost the same principles as question 3.My initial subset here as well as in Q3 is 772 for convinience.

5) I just changed my testing file for Kaggle
